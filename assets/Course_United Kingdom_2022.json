The module analyses the consequences for countries seeking closer economic integration through successively more ambitious forms. This begins with a limited trade arrangement, followed by a common market, which also allows free movement of capital and migrant workers, and a Single Market. The final part of the module examines monetary integration, beginning with exchange rate stabilisation and then considering Monetary Union. The module aims to combine principles of economic analysis with an assessment of the impact of such measures on the member economies.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>In this module, we will explore the long-run, historical determinants of the wealth of nations. We will begin by taking a long-run view on modern economic growth, showing how this has led to dramatic changes in the relative wealth of nations over the last 500 years. We will then ask two key questions: why have modern economic growth started in some places rather than others? And while have some countries been able to catch up, while others have not? These investigations will improve our understanding of why are some countries much richer than others, and will give us some important insights on how to promote sustained growth in developing countries. The module draws on a vibrant new literature in economics that looks at comparative development as the outcome of a long historical process, and uses techniques originally developed in economics to improve our understanding of history. Without going into the technical details, the module reviews the main findings of this literature, discusses their implications for modern development experiences, and lays out the main challenges for future research. By providing an historical perspective on growth and development, the module will endow students with a better understanding of contemporary economic issues. It will also give them some exciting examples of how the economic techniques they will learn in later modules can be used to understand the world better.</p>",

A variety of market settings are considered, ranging from the paradigm of perfect competition to the analysis of monopolistic firms. The module continues by providing an introduction to the normative evaluation of economic outcomes and market failures. The module also introduces students to the essential skills required for study as an economist.",

      "summary": "<p>We start by laying the foundations of macroeconomic models with the use of very stylized one and two-period models in which consumers, firms and governments interact in the goods and factor markets. We will discuss how to solve macroeconomic models in the computer with the aid of these simple economies. We next move to study the determinants of long-run economic growth. The overarching question that we will study is: why are some countries so much richer than others? We will study several mechanisms that can potentially account for these differences, namely, capital accumulation, knowledge production and institutions. This section does not seek to be an exhaustive survey of models of economic growth; it intends to highlight the mechanisms at play in a broad class of models. We will also place a strong emphasis on how to take the predictions derived from these models to the data. In the last section of the module, we turn our attention towards the ‘short run’. We will embed the consumption and labour supply decision studied at the beginning of the semester into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the macroeconomy, the standard real business cycle (RBC) model developed by Kydland and Prescott. We will study the investment decision of firms, and close the module by studying the search and matching model of unemployment of Mortensen and Pissarides.</p>",

It begins by analysing how the economic choices of households and firms can be understood using consumer and producer theory. It then looks at how these individual choices are aggregated into market demand and supply to be mediated through the price mechanism. A variety of market settings are considered, ranging from the paradigm of perfect competition to the analysis of monopolistic firms. The module continues by providing an introduction to the normative evaluation of economic outcomes and market failures. The second semester considers macroeconomics - the study of the aggregate economy. This part will focus on the determinants of aggregate output, both in the short run - addressing cyclical movements of booms and busts - and in the long run - providing an introduction to economic growth. A running theme will be debates over the role of the government in macroeconomic management, covering fiscal and monetary policy. The module will introduce a series of basic models used in modern macroeconomics; The module also introduces students to the essential skills required for study as an economist.",

In the first part of the module, we study large sample, or asymptotic, theory. This is needed in order to obtain tractable results about the behaviour of estimators and tests when the standard modelling assumptions - which frequently cannot be verified in practice - are relaxed. The second part of the module continues the time series analysis taken in Econometric Theory II, with the emphasis on the behaviour of typical economic time series, and the implications of that behaviour in practical analysis, such as the construction of models linking economic time series. The key issues addressed will be the identification of non-stationarity through the construction of formal tests and the implications for modelling with non-stationary data. Particular attention will be paid to the contributions of Sir Clive Granger to the spurious regression problem and to cointegration analysis, for which he was ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize.</span></span></p>",

We then move on to introduce some frontier models where the role of firm heterogeneity in shaping the structure and the effects of trade is analysed. Next, review three applications of these models. First, we analyse a framework where trade openness can affect the growth rate of output in the long-run by increasing firms’ incentives to innovate. In recent decades a substantial number of firms has chosen to reach foreign consumers by establishing branches abroad. In our second application we therefore analyse the role of multinational corporations in international trade. In the third application we study the conditions under which active industrial policies, including trade protection, may be beneficial.</p><p><br>The module aims to enable the participants to develop:<br>Reflection of understanding of material through tutorial questions.</p>",

Students will establish knowledge of state-of-the-art prediction techniques including SVMs, temporal Nearest Neighbour models, Ensembles and Deep Learning. Practical exercises will be set against a range of real world based datasets and time series data. Focusing on the applicability of models to real world problems the module will consider the appropriateness and utility of each method with respect to common \"tricky\" data properties in real world data that lead to under-performing models. Examples include unbalanced classes, heterogeneous input feature types and detrimentally large number of input features. Within the module methods to unpack the various predictive models to understand why they predict what they do and the utility of this information in various business contexts will be covered. This module is taught primarily using Python against a background of industrial workflow data modelling environments (e.g. SPSS Modeller, Orange) where applicable.</p>",

      "credits": 10,
      "level": 4,
      "summary": "<p>Session 1: What is a Market? A service ecosystem approach to understanding markets<br>We examine the argument that marketing produces markets and that marketing practices and theories play a significant role in the production of markets. &nbsp;We explore the view that markets are systems, specifically service ecosystems, which are relatively self-contained and self-adjusting systems of resource integrating actors connected by shared institutional logics and mutual value creation through service exchange.</p><p>Session 2: Organisational buying behaviour and market structures<br>We examine the types of organisational buyer and their buying needs. The influence of macro and micro factors on organisational decision making are considered, as are differing types of market structures on buying processes.</p><p>Session 3: How do markets work? Creating and shaping new markets and maintaining market dynamics.<br>We examine why partnerships and alliances form between organisations. Market transactions and relational exchanges are contrasted, and the role of relationship dynamics (such as power and dependence, commitment, and mutual benefits) is considered. We also look at some of the reasons why inter-organisational relationships may fail.</p><p>Session 4: Forming business networks: business network partnership attraction<br>The network perspective is compared and contrasted with the supply chain and marketing channel concepts and is used to capture the interconnectedness of business interactions. We look at the value of a stakeholder perspective and the embeddedness of firms within networks. We examine how and why firms are attracted to each other to form networks, and the role of characteristics such as trust in their formation.</p><p>Session 5: Business-to-Business marketing strategies<br>How do issues of “management” and “managing” marketing strategy relate to business networks? What do we understand by segmentation, targeting and positioning in business-to-business markets, and how do we undertake this?</p><p>Session 6: Branding and building loyalty: value co-creation in network partnerships<br>We explore the significance of business customer value perceptions and the development of a business brand both in terms of how marketing communications can be linked to the nature of inter-organisational relationships, and how branding can act as facilitator for value co-creation and loyalty in business markets.</p><p>Session 7: Innovation in business networks<br>Issues such as customisation and personalisation are explored, and we take a network perspective on innovation processes and how this raises issues of confidentiality and neutrality in new product and service development in networks. We also look at the rising importance of business services available to client organisations, and the challenges of managing marketing in professional service organisations.</p><p>Session 8: Strategic Market Relations in the Digital World<br>We examine how technology and digital media is impacting strategic market relations, in particular: marketing actions such as price setting and competitive bidding processes through online auctions; strategizing in business-to-business e-commerce platforms; the use of social media to build and maintain business networks; and the use of digital media to extend market reach and support customer relationship management.</p><p>Session 9: Managing business networks: communication, coordination and learning in business networks<br>We examine the role of the modern salesforce and its relationship to strategic networks, including approaches to Key Account Management. We look at the role of communication and coordination as ways of facilitating learning in strategic business networks, and ask: what do we mean by learning in network?<br>&nbsp;</p>",
      "aims": "<p>The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the main theoretical and managerial concepts and issues in the area of business-to-business marketing and strategic market relations. We explore the complex dynamics of networked relationships between buying and selling organisations. Such networks offer organisations the opportunity to learn and create value in novel and innovative ways. However, they also constrain the actions of individual organisations in the network. Thus, strategic market relations require firms to understand how to build, manage, and leverage their market relationships.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The purpose of this course is to help students better understand the theory and processes of entrepreneurial sales and negotiation to develop the skills to sell and negotiate successfully in a variety of business settings. Readings, exercises, and examples relate to the broad spectrum of negotiations that business professionals face with colleagues, employers, employees, clients, competitors, and others. These include a range of substantive issues such as purchase and sale transactions, contract negotiations, salary negotiations, workplace disputes, inter-organizational relationships, multiparty private/public negotiations, and negotiations regarding organizational change.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales theory and exercises build the basic understanding required to plan and successfully execute a sales revenue stream for entrepreneurial organisations.</p>",
      "aims": "<p>Entrepreneurial sales and negotiations are two of the most important skills for entrepreneurial success. After all, as is often said ‘nothing progresses until you make a sale’. To this could be added the need for repeat high quality sales. Sometime the most successful companies don’t have the best offering, they have the best negotiations outcomes and sales acquisition processes. The two topics are highly synergistic, developing key listening and communications skills, an understanding of the tactical use of information, as well as helping form customer empathy and customer centric thinking. The course therefore addresses both the theory and the practice of sales and negotiation. &nbsp;Accordingly, the learning objectives range from analytical/conceptual/cognitive to behavioural to attitudinal and metacognitive. &nbsp;Class sessions are highly interactive: students will not only read and talk about sales and negotiation, they will also do it. &nbsp;Most class sessions will centre on sales/negotiation simulations and other interactive exercises. &nbsp;Students will learn from their own negotiating experiences inside and outside the classroom, and from their classmates’ experiences. &nbsp;To help guide students’ experiential learning, and in the spirit of Kurt Lewin’s observation that there is nothing so practical as a good theory, students will also study a number of sales and negotiation concepts, theories, and frameworks. &nbsp;As sales and negotiation are inherently inter-disciplinary, the theoretical component of the course draws from a variety of traditional disciplines, including business, law, psychology, management, economics, game theory, and philosophy.</p>",
