<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="img/Screenshot-filter.png" alt="Module Filter Screenshot" />

Better UX for the UoN course catalogue. 
<a href="https://campus.nottingham.ac.uk/psp/csprd_pub/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/UN_PROG_AND_MOD_EXTRACT.UN_PAM_CRSE_EXTRCT.GBL">The official catalogue</a> contains abundant useful information regarding modules and academic plans, but is extremely frustrating to use.
Built for potential or current students to better utilise publicly available data for their plan or module choices, Nott Course is featured with

- FULL data of current year's catalogue;
- Responsive UI design;
- Free navigation from plans to modules;
- Advanced filters for modules and plans;
- Easy drafting of module selections;
- Generating a list of assessments based on selected modules.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/EricWay1024/nott-course/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.

**The current developers have graduated from UoN. If you would like to take over this project, please contact me via the email at the bottom of this page.**
