The module analyses the consequences for countries seeking closer economic integration through successively more ambitious forms. This begins with a limited trade arrangement, followed by a common market, which also allows free movement of capital and migrant workers, and a Single Market. The final part of the module examines monetary integration, beginning with exchange rate stabilisation and then considering Monetary Union. The module aims to combine principles of economic analysis with an assessment of the impact of such measures on the member economies.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>In this module, we will explore the long-run, historical determinants of the wealth of nations. We will begin by taking a long-run view on modern economic growth, showing how this has led to dramatic changes in the relative wealth of nations over the last 500 years. We will then ask two key questions: why have modern economic growth started in some places rather than others? And while have some countries been able to catch up, while others have not? These investigations will improve our understanding of why are some countries much richer than others, and will give us some important insights on how to promote sustained growth in developing countries. The module draws on a vibrant new literature in economics that looks at comparative development as the outcome of a long historical process, and uses techniques originally developed in economics to improve our understanding of history. Without going into the technical details, the module reviews the main findings of this literature, discusses their implications for modern development experiences, and lays out the main challenges for future research. By providing an historical perspective on growth and development, the module will endow students with a better understanding of contemporary economic issues. It will also give them some exciting examples of how the economic techniques they will learn in later modules can be used to understand the world better.</p>",

A variety of market settings are considered, ranging from the paradigm of perfect competition to the analysis of monopolistic firms. The module continues by providing an introduction to the normative evaluation of economic outcomes and market failures. The module also introduces students to the essential skills required for study as an economist.",

      "summary": "<p>We start by laying the foundations of macroeconomic models with the use of very stylized one and two-period models in which consumers, firms and governments interact in the goods and factor markets. We will discuss how to solve macroeconomic models in the computer with the aid of these simple economies. We next move to study the determinants of long-run economic growth. The overarching question that we will study is: why are some countries so much richer than others? We will study several mechanisms that can potentially account for these differences, namely, capital accumulation, knowledge production and institutions. This section does not seek to be an exhaustive survey of models of economic growth; it intends to highlight the mechanisms at play in a broad class of models. We will also place a strong emphasis on how to take the predictions derived from these models to the data. In the last section of the module, we turn our attention towards the ‘short run’. We will embed the consumption and labour supply decision studied at the beginning of the semester into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the macroeconomy, the standard real business cycle (RBC) model developed by Kydland and Prescott. We will study the investment decision of firms, and close the module by studying the search and matching model of unemployment of Mortensen and Pissarides.</p>",

It begins by analysing how the economic choices of households and firms can be understood using consumer and producer theory. It then looks at how these individual choices are aggregated into market demand and supply to be mediated through the price mechanism. A variety of market settings are considered, ranging from the paradigm of perfect competition to the analysis of monopolistic firms. The module continues by providing an introduction to the normative evaluation of economic outcomes and market failures. The second semester considers macroeconomics - the study of the aggregate economy. This part will focus on the determinants of aggregate output, both in the short run - addressing cyclical movements of booms and busts - and in the long run - providing an introduction to economic growth. A running theme will be debates over the role of the government in macroeconomic management, covering fiscal and monetary policy. The module will introduce a series of basic models used in modern macroeconomics; The module also introduces students to the essential skills required for study as an economist.",

In the first part of the module, we study large sample, or asymptotic, theory. This is needed in order to obtain tractable results about the behaviour of estimators and tests when the standard modelling assumptions - which frequently cannot be verified in practice - are relaxed. The second part of the module continues the time series analysis taken in Econometric Theory II, with the emphasis on the behaviour of typical economic time series, and the implications of that behaviour in practical analysis, such as the construction of models linking economic time series. The key issues addressed will be the identification of non-stationarity through the construction of formal tests and the implications for modelling with non-stationary data. Particular attention will be paid to the contributions of Sir Clive Granger to the spurious regression problem and to cointegration analysis, for which he was ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize.</span></span></p>",

We then move on to introduce some frontier models where the role of firm heterogeneity in shaping the structure and the effects of trade is analysed. Next, review three applications of these models. First, we analyse a framework where trade openness can affect the growth rate of output in the long-run by increasing firms’ incentives to innovate. In recent decades a substantial number of firms has chosen to reach foreign consumers by establishing branches abroad. In our second application we therefore analyse the role of multinational corporations in international trade. In the third application we study the conditions under which active industrial policies, including trade protection, may be beneficial.</p><p><br>The module aims to enable the participants to develop:<br>Reflection of understanding of material through tutorial questions.</p>",

Students will establish knowledge of state-of-the-art prediction techniques including SVMs, temporal Nearest Neighbour models, Ensembles and Deep Learning. Practical exercises will be set against a range of real world based datasets and time series data. Focusing on the applicability of models to real world problems the module will consider the appropriateness and utility of each method with respect to common \"tricky\" data properties in real world data that lead to under-performing models. Examples include unbalanced classes, heterogeneous input feature types and detrimentally large number of input features. Within the module methods to unpack the various predictive models to understand why they predict what they do and the utility of this information in various business contexts will be covered. This module is taught primarily using Python against a background of industrial workflow data modelling environments (e.g. SPSS Modeller, Orange) where applicable.</p>",

      "credits": 10,
      "level": 4,
      "summary": "<p>Session 1: What is a Market? A service ecosystem approach to understanding markets<br>We examine the argument that marketing produces markets and that marketing practices and theories play a significant role in the production of markets. &nbsp;We explore the view that markets are systems, specifically service ecosystems, which are relatively self-contained and self-adjusting systems of resource integrating actors connected by shared institutional logics and mutual value creation through service exchange.</p><p>Session 2: Organisational buying behaviour and market structures<br>We examine the types of organisational buyer and their buying needs. The influence of macro and micro factors on organisational decision making are considered, as are differing types of market structures on buying processes.</p><p>Session 3: How do markets work? Creating and shaping new markets and maintaining market dynamics.<br>We examine why partnerships and alliances form between organisations. Market transactions and relational exchanges are contrasted, and the role of relationship dynamics (such as power and dependence, commitment, and mutual benefits) is considered. We also look at some of the reasons why inter-organisational relationships may fail.</p><p>Session 4: Forming business networks: business network partnership attraction<br>The network perspective is compared and contrasted with the supply chain and marketing channel concepts and is used to capture the interconnectedness of business interactions. We look at the value of a stakeholder perspective and the embeddedness of firms within networks. We examine how and why firms are attracted to each other to form networks, and the role of characteristics such as trust in their formation.</p><p>Session 5: Business-to-Business marketing strategies<br>How do issues of “management” and “managing” marketing strategy relate to business networks? What do we understand by segmentation, targeting and positioning in business-to-business markets, and how do we undertake this?</p><p>Session 6: Branding and building loyalty: value co-creation in network partnerships<br>We explore the significance of business customer value perceptions and the development of a business brand both in terms of how marketing communications can be linked to the nature of inter-organisational relationships, and how branding can act as facilitator for value co-creation and loyalty in business markets.</p><p>Session 7: Innovation in business networks<br>Issues such as customisation and personalisation are explored, and we take a network perspective on innovation processes and how this raises issues of confidentiality and neutrality in new product and service development in networks. We also look at the rising importance of business services available to client organisations, and the challenges of managing marketing in professional service organisations.</p><p>Session 8: Strategic Market Relations in the Digital World<br>We examine how technology and digital media is impacting strategic market relations, in particular: marketing actions such as price setting and competitive bidding processes through online auctions; strategizing in business-to-business e-commerce platforms; the use of social media to build and maintain business networks; and the use of digital media to extend market reach and support customer relationship management.</p><p>Session 9: Managing business networks: communication, coordination and learning in business networks<br>We examine the role of the modern salesforce and its relationship to strategic networks, including approaches to Key Account Management. We look at the role of communication and coordination as ways of facilitating learning in strategic business networks, and ask: what do we mean by learning in network?<br>&nbsp;</p>",
      "aims": "<p>The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the main theoretical and managerial concepts and issues in the area of business-to-business marketing and strategic market relations. We explore the complex dynamics of networked relationships between buying and selling organisations. Such networks offer organisations the opportunity to learn and create value in novel and innovative ways. However, they also constrain the actions of individual organisations in the network. Thus, strategic market relations require firms to understand how to build, manage, and leverage their market relationships.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The purpose of this course is to help students better understand the theory and processes of entrepreneurial sales and negotiation to develop the skills to sell and negotiate successfully in a variety of business settings. Readings, exercises, and examples relate to the broad spectrum of negotiations that business professionals face with colleagues, employers, employees, clients, competitors, and others. These include a range of substantive issues such as purchase and sale transactions, contract negotiations, salary negotiations, workplace disputes, inter-organizational relationships, multiparty private/public negotiations, and negotiations regarding organizational change.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales theory and exercises build the basic understanding required to plan and successfully execute a sales revenue stream for entrepreneurial organisations.</p>",
      "aims": "<p>Entrepreneurial sales and negotiations are two of the most important skills for entrepreneurial success. After all, as is often said ‘nothing progresses until you make a sale’. To this could be added the need for repeat high quality sales. Sometime the most successful companies don’t have the best offering, they have the best negotiations outcomes and sales acquisition processes. The two topics are highly synergistic, developing key listening and communications skills, an understanding of the tactical use of information, as well as helping form customer empathy and customer centric thinking. The course therefore addresses both the theory and the practice of sales and negotiation. &nbsp;Accordingly, the learning objectives range from analytical/conceptual/cognitive to behavioural to attitudinal and metacognitive. &nbsp;Class sessions are highly interactive: students will not only read and talk about sales and negotiation, they will also do it. &nbsp;Most class sessions will centre on sales/negotiation simulations and other interactive exercises. &nbsp;Students will learn from their own negotiating experiences inside and outside the classroom, and from their classmates’ experiences. &nbsp;To help guide students’ experiential learning, and in the spirit of Kurt Lewin’s observation that there is nothing so practical as a good theory, students will also study a number of sales and negotiation concepts, theories, and frameworks. &nbsp;As sales and negotiation are inherently inter-disciplinary, the theoretical component of the course draws from a variety of traditional disciplines, including business, law, psychology, management, economics, game theory, and philosophy.</p>",

We examine the fundamentals of the relational database model, as well as implementations of the model in database management systems (DBMS) and languages to interact with them such as Structured Query Language (SQL). We explore relevant software design principles such as understanding user needs, requirements and software specifications and how this relates to database design and implementation.

Computational optimization is one of the most important<br>areas within operations research (OR), which is a discipline that uses modelling techniques, analytics and computational methods to solve complex problems in industry and business. In this module you will learn to interpret and develop algebraic models for a variety of real-world linear and discrete optimization problems to then use powerful optimization software (linear, integer and mixed-integer solvers) to produce a solution. The module covers topics such as linear programming, integer programming, combinatorial optimization, modelling and optimization software, and multi-objective optimization among others. Optimization technology is ubiquitous in today's world, for applications in logistics, finance, manufacturing, workforce planning, product selection, healthcare, and any other area where the limited resources must be used efficiently. Optimization enables prescriptive analytics in order to support and automate decision-making. You will spend around four hours per week in lectures and workshops for this module.</p>",

To address correctness we use a formal approach to proving that an algorithm meets its specification.

To address the issue of efficiency we cover the use of mathematical descriptions of the computational resources needed to support algorithm design decisions. You'll study topics such as: sorting algorithms, heaps, binary search trees, hashmaps, and graph algorithms. The emphasis is upon understanding data structures and algorithms so as to be able to design and select them appropriately for solving a given problem.&nbsp;</p>",

This module considers both the structure of databases, including how to make them fast, efficient and reliable, and the appropriate user interfaces which will make them easy to interact with for users. You will start by looking at how to design a database, gaining an understanding of the standard features that management systems provide and how you can best utilise them and then develop an interactive application to access your database. Throughout the lectures and computing sessions you will learn how to design and implement systems using a standard database management system, web technologies and GUI interfaces through practical programming/system examples. You will spend around three hours per week in lectures and two hours per week in organised computer labs studying for this module, and will be expected to spend additional time practising and completing your coursework.</p>",

To appreciate impossibility proofs based upon diagonalisation arguments. To introduce the fact that there are problems that cannot possibly be solved on a computer.

While the specifics of the resulting topic coverage is not fixed, the module will ensure focus upon the latest threats and defences, as well as the requirements for and/or application of computer security in the context of emerging technologies. The module will also ensure the coverage of relevant aspects is approached from an interdisciplinary perspective. Each week, a student (or a group of students) will make a one-hour presentation on an assigned topic in computer security followed by a discussion. The student(s) will meet with a member of staff to discuss and plan the form of the presentation. The student(s) should also prepare some questions for the audience and write a concise (10 page) summary of the material.</p>",

The field of Big Data has many different faces such as databases, security and privacy, visualisation, computational infrastructure or data analytics/mining. This module will provide the following concepts:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1.  Introduction to Big data: introducing the main principles behind distributed/parallel systems with data intensive applications, identifying key challenges: capture, store, search, analyse and visualise the data.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>2. SQL Databases vs. NoSQL Databases: understand the growing amounts of data; the relational database management systems (RDBMS); overview of Structured Query Languages (e.g. SQL); introduction to NoSQL databases; understanding the difference between a relational DBMS and a NoSQL database; Identifying the need to employ a NoSQL DB.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3. Big Data frameworks and how to deal with big data: this includes the MapReduce programming model, as well as an overview of recent technologies (Hadoop ecosystem, and Apache Spark). Then, you will learn how to interact with the latest APIs of Apache Spark (RDDs, DataFrames and Datasets) to create distributed programs capable of dealing with big datasets (using Python and/or Scala) &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>4. Finally, we will dive into the data mining and machine learning part of the course, including data preprocessing approaches (to obtain quality data), distributed machine learning algorithms and data stream algorithms. To do so, you will use the Machine learning library of Apache Spark (MLlib) to understand how some machine learning algorithms (e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, k-means) can be deployed at a scale.</p>",

The classical inference component of the module builds on the ideas of mathematical statistics introduced in MATH2011. Topics such as sufficiency, estimating equations, likelihood ratio tests and best-unbiased estimators are explored in detail. There is special emphasis on the exponential family of distributions, which includes many standard distributions such as the normal, Poisson, binomial and gamma. In Bayesian inference, there are three basic ingredients: a prior distribution, a likelihood and a posterior distribution, which are linked by Bayes' theorem. Inference is based on the posterior distribution, and topics including conjugacy, vague prior knowledge, marginal and predictive inference, normal inverse gamma inference, and categorical data are pursued. Common concepts, such as likelihood and sufficiency, are used to link and contrast the two approaches to inference. Students will gain experience of the theory and concepts underlying much contemporary research in statistical inference and methodology. Students will gain experience of using statistical software and interpreting its output.</p>",

Fundamental concepts, such as independence, conditioning, moments, joint distributions, transformations and generating functions are discussed in detail. This part concludes with an introduction to some probabilstic inequalities, limit theorems and the multivariate normal distribution.<br>The second part of the module gives an introduction to stochastic processes, i.e. random processes that evolve with time. The focus is on discrete-time Markov chains, which are fundamental to the wider study of stochastic processes. Topics covered include transition matrices, recurrence and transience, irreducibility, periodicity, equilibrium distributions, ergodic theorems, absorption probabilities, mean passage times and reversibility. Discrete-time renewal processes and branching processes are considered as applications. The module finishes with an introduction to simple one-dimensional random walks, including sample path diagrams, the reflection principle, recurrence and transience, first passage probabilities and arcsine laws. Computer Lab sessions will be used to illustrate the theory using a statistical computer package.</p>",

A wide range of statistical models will be introduced to provide an appreciation of the scope of the subject and to demonstrate the central role of parametric statistical models. The key concepts of inference including estimation and hypothesis testing will be described. Special emphasis will be placed on maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests. While numerical examples and computer lab sessions will be used to motivate and illustrate, the content will emphasise the mathematical basis of statistics. Topics include maximum likelihood estimation, confidence intervals, likelihood ratio tests, categorical data analysis and non-parametric procedures.<br>The second part of the course introduces a wide class of techniques such as regression, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance and experimental design which are used in a variety of quantitative subjects. Topics covered include the general linear model, least squares estimation, normal linear models, simple and multiple regression, practical data analysis, and assessment of model adequacy. As well as developing the theory, practical experience will be obtained by the use of a statistical computer package.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Commutative algebra is the foundation of modern pure mathematics: everything from Fermat’s Last Theorem to cryptography depends on the ideas developed in commutative algebra. Many of the ideas discussed in this module were developed during the 20th century. This module marks the transition from “historical” mathematics to “modern” mathematics as practiced by researchers today. We will learn about commutative rings and fields which unify ideas from the integers and the rational or complex numbers. Originally introduced by Hilbert and further developed by Noether and others in the 20th century, ring theory allows mathematicians today to take ideas from one area (such as geometry) to solve questions in another area of mathematics (such as number theory). Fields and field extensions were originally developed by Galois in the 19th century to understand the roots of polynomial equations. Modern-day mathematics uses them in the Langlands program which is widely seen as the single biggest project in modern mathematical research: a far-reaching conjectural program that connects number theory with geometry. A student who completes this module successfully will have learnt the basics of the “language of modern mathematics”.</p>",

Free groups are at the core of the Nielsen-Schreier theorem and the Todd-Coxeter algorithm which provide combinatorial techniques to obtain presentations of groups. In addition to developing these fundamental results, this course develops techniques to manipulate group presentations and applies these techniques, for example, to the understanding of group extensions. The methods studied in the course may be automated and have been implemented on computers.</p>",

Students will receive lectures on and study a specific social neuroscience issue in detail, and will devise ways to further research into that issue. The course will provide an introduction to neuroscience methods and will focus on current research and theory behind various aspects of human social interaction, speech communication and body perception from a neuroscience perspective. Complementary evidence from different branches of behavioural and cognitive sciences will be integrated with current neuroscientific research. The course will focus predominantly on the neural mechanisms thought to be involved in the interpretation of our own and others’ bodies, actions, faces, voices and emotions. The course will also provide advice on developing ideas for research as well as how to write for each assessment.</font></span></span></p>",

Students will see how specific brain regions influence, or are involved in specific behaviours (e.g., body representation, action perception, speech perception). Students will understand the powerful inferences that can be drawn from neuroscientific techniques, and will also appreciate the limitations of such techniques. The students will be able to evaluate how neuroscience can be integrated with other psychological disciplines. Students will be able to critically evaluate this exciting field of psychology. Students will be expected and encouraged to read primary source material and to generate original lines of investigation.

      "summary": "<p>The course will cover theories and models of altruism, cooperation and helping form the perspective of psychology, economics and evolutionary biology. Among the theories examined will be reputation based, strong-reciprocity, warm-glow and crowding and altruistic punishment from economics; kin selection, reciprocity, coercion, mutualism, cooperative breeding from biology; and empathy, personality, sexual selection and situational constraints from psychology. The course will consider why people sometimes dont help and actively try to benefit from others (e.g., Free-riding) and apply these models to anti-social behaviour, and how we cooperate to inflict injury on other groups. The course will also examine not just models of helping others, but also why people ask for help. The course will finally look at how charities implement some of these principles and if they are successful.</p>",
      "aims": "<p>This module aims to explore human altruism and cooperation. Whether or not humans are selfish or selfless by nature is a fundamental question central to understanding human behaviour. The module will explore this question from the standpoint of empirical and theoretical work within psychology, economics and biology. The module’s role within the context of the psychology degree is it exploration this fundamental question by drawing on a wide diversity of psychological theory (personality, social psychology, learning theory, cognitive psychology, biological and developmental psychology) and integrating these with economic and biological theories of altruism and cooperation. Thus this simple question (are humans selfish or selfless?) allows for a wide diversity of material across the discipline to be brought together to focus on a single fundamental question. While the psychology course teaches personality, social psychology, cognitive psychology, biological psychology and learning theory as separate modules this module will integrate principles from all of these aspects of psychology in a way that it is not covered by other core modules within the course. Hence the students will get a unique experience of understanding how these different perspective within psychology can be brought together to focus on a single question. This module will also provide students with an appreciation of interdisciplinary work across psychology, economics and biology.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The central theme of this module is to explore how the architecture and function of the visual brain has been designed and shaped by experiences over a range of timescales. The innate properties of the eye and visual brain that are present at birth have been designed over millions of years of evolution. The brain continues to physically change it structure and function within a lifetime  a property termed brain plasticity. Over the years of development, brain plasticity is the driving force for the maturation of different visual brain functions. Even well into adulthood, plasticity is retained in the form of learning, which can optimise performance for certain visual tasks and be exploited for therapeutic uses. Another prominent form of plasticity in the visual brain is that caused by adaptation  effects of visual experience over the preceding tens of milliseconds to minutes. The module will examine the consequences of evolution, development, learning and adaptation for visual brain function and perception. <br><br><br><br></p>",

      "level": 2,
      "summary": "<p>This module offers a critical introduction to understanding America's place in the world. It provides historical and political analyses of U.S. foreign relations, looking at the themes and traditions that have shaped America's increasing influence in global affairs from the late nineteenth century to the present day. From the war of 1898 to the conflicts of the early twenty-first century, it examines how America's involvement abroad has changed over time. How can we understand the evolution of America's relationship with the wider world; what interests and themes have lay behind the execution of American power? The course analyses traditional political and diplomatic issues, as well as the link between foreign and domestic policies, the role of foreign actors and private organisations-from religious groups to citizen organisations to NGOs that have served to shape America's actions abroad. It also engages with important contemporary trends in the historiography of U.S. foreign policy, including those that emphasise the significance of race, gender, emotions, and religion.</p><p>Students who need to complete one or more components of assessment during the summer, due to extenuating circumstances or for progression purposes, will be required to submit one essay of 2,000 words. This form of assessment has been set in order to accommodate early submission deadlines for candidates undertaking a year of study abroad, who will not be resident in Nottingham during the usual summer examination period. The essay will be due on the third Wednesday in July.</p>",
      "aims": "<p>The module is aimed toward challenging students to think critically about the course of US foreign relations in the era known as the ‘American Century.’ Students should have a good understanding of the key events and case studies, but they should also be able to put these into a larger context and develop innovative and nuanced ways of examining them. There will be a large emphasis on tackling the different ways that historians have interpreted US foreign policy, but students will be asked to utilise primary source materials, too, in order to form their own assessments and arguments.</p>",

      "credits": 20,

      "summary": "<p>This interdisciplinary module examines the role played by American popular music in countercultural movements. It focuses on the ways in which marginalised, subordinate or dissenting social groups have used popular music as a vehicle for self-definition and for re-negotiating their relationship to the social, economic and cultural mainstream. It explores how the mainstream has responded to music countercultures in ways that range from repression to co-optation. And it analyses how the music and the movements have been represented and reflected on in fiction, film, poetry, journalism and theory. A central concern of the module is to evaluate the effectiveness and potential of popular music as a socially-critical or oppositional force. The module is built around case studies of key issues and moments in American popular music history. One of the key issues is the debate over the ownership and use of African-American musical resources, from nineteenth-century minstrelsy to twenty-first century hip hop. Another is the function of commercial entertainment institutions in mediating between music subcultures, political countercultures, and the mainstream culture. Among the key moments examined are the folk revival and the 1930s Popular Front, rock 'n' roll and desegregation in the 1950s, rock music and the 1960s counterculture, postmodernism and identity politics in the music of the MTV age and the relationship between hip hop culture and neoliberalism in the early twenty-first century.&nbsp;</p>",

In addition, consideration will be given to the cultural dimension of Americas relationship with India and Pakistan. Cinematic and literary depictions of US-South Asian relations, encompassing issues of race, religion, gender and neo-colonialism, will be critically examined.

      "credits": 20,
      "level": 4,
      "summary": "<p>This interdisciplinary module examines the role played by American popular music in countercultural movements. It focuses on the ways in which marginalised, subordinate or dissenting social groups have used popular music as a vehicle for self-definition and for re-negotiating their relationship to the social, economic and cultural mainstream. It explores how the mainstream has responded to music countercultures in ways that range from repression to co-optation. And it analyses how the music and the movements have been represented and reflected on in fiction, film, poetry, journalism and theory. A central concern of the module is to evaluate the effectiveness and potential of popular music as a socially-critical or oppositional force. The module is built around case studies of key issues and moments in American popular music history. One of the key issues is the debate over the ownership and use of African-American musical resources, from nineteenth-century minstrelsy to twenty-first century hip-hop.&nbsp;Another is the function of commercial entertainment institutions in mediating between music subcultures, political countercultures, and the mainstream culture. Among the key moments examined are the folk revival and the 1930s Popular Front, rock 'n' roll&nbsp;and desegregation in the 1950s, rock music and the 1960s counterculture, and&nbsp;postmodernism and identity politics in the music of the MTV age, and the relationship between hip hop culture and neoliberalism in the early twenty-first century.</p>",
      "aims": "<p>This module aims to provide students with an understanding of the relationship between musical form, social history and ideology. It will introduce students to a range of debates about and theoretical perspectives on the politics of popular music. It will provide in-depth exploration of relevant case studies from the Nineteenth Century to the present, covering a variety of music genres and historical contexts. And it will utilise a wide range of materials and sources, encouraging students to take an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis and understanding of cultural forms and texts.</p>",

Literary (textual) criticism, visual culture, and cultural/intellectual/political history - along with interdisciplinary work – will be discussed in a seminar setting. Moving chronologically across more than 200 years of American culture, each week a different departmental expert in a particular American Studies discipline will assign and discuss some examples of her/his published work (an article or book chapter), discussing not only the content, but also how the work fits within the field of American Studies, and the process of writing and researching in this area. These readings will accompany a key article that defined or changed that particular area of American Studies. Students will be encouraged to recognise particular methodologies and approaches, with a view to testing out and developing their own preferred intellectual approaches along the way, in a coursework essay and in the dissertation proposal. The focus will be on issues, figures, events and texts (visual as well as written) that have been “stopping places” in the development of American Studies: points where disciplines have come together or have been added to the founding literature/history axis.</span></span></p>",

It encourages them to be self-reflexive about the theory and practice of research, to apply methodology to their research, to develop analytical skills and to engage with the practical skills required for the written and oral presentation of research. They will be encouraged to improve their ability to think critically and conceptually. They will be expected to recognise that research requires engagement with complex, erratic and ambiguous incidents and materials and they will thereby develop a sceptical or critical view about sources of information and learn to provide intelligent order to facts, perceptions and interpretations.</span></span></p>",

It will enable students to become more effective researchers and develop a range of transferable professional skills—from writing and presentation to public engagement and project management. Routes through the module include compulsory and elective courses offered by the Faculty of Arts Researcher Skills Programme, the central Graduate School Researcher Development Programme, and the Social Sciences and Arts Graduate Centre Programme. Students will work with their supervisors to identify which of the skills from these programmes they should prioritise for their development. In addition, students will be required to attend their Department’s Postgraduate Professional Development Programme (which incorporates occasional seminars and postgraduate-led events alongside weekly peer review sessions and lectures by visiting academics). These sessions are intended to give students the opportunity to receive detailed feedback on their written work from their peers, and allow them to develop a range of important skills relating to critical interrogation, intellectual clarity, and verbal articulacy. These skills will prove crucial to the successful completion of their degree and in relation to things such as conference presentations, funding applications and (academic or non-academic) job interviews. The minimum expectation of students is that they complete the two mandatory courses from the Graduate School Researcher Programme in this semester and regularly attend Work-in-Progress sessions within their Department. Their initial Development Needs Analysis can then be further refined after the completion of these strands. The core assessment element of this module, the Literature Review, is a significant first step in establishing the theoretical framework and source base for the MRes dissertation. The feedback on it provided by the student’s supervisors will enable them to go on to plan the overall chapter structure and basic thesis of their dissertation, as well as develop an awareness of any archival resources that may need to be drawn on in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The module adopts a multi- and interdisciplinary approach to the border as a place, culture and concept and moves from the colonial period into the twenty-first century. We will analyse a diverse range of historical, literary and cultural texts (testimony, fiction, poetry, drama, film, television, art, architecture, music and performance) and engage a series of critical debates about the nature of cultural and ethnic encounter, race, nation and empire. The module challenges traditional approaches to the study of these two regions, including dominant narratives about colonial conquest, expansion of the frontier, identity formation and the nation-state. A study of these two regions positions North America as a transnational space characterised by a series of porous borders, contact zones and relations of power, conflict and exchange. Students are encouraged to engage critically with the theoretical frameworks and concepts used to understand the borderlands experience more broadly, for example, racialisation, hybridity, métissage/mestizaje, transculturation and transnationalism. Ultimately, how does the borderlands experience inform our understanding of the shifting parameters of race, culture, ethnicity and nation in North America?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">This module introduces students to the conflicting views about business that can be heard echoing through American literature and culture in the last two centuries. These views are evident when literature and culture directly represent the business culture—its executives, managers and employees, or the physical and mental conditions of employment and entrepreneurship; they are also evident in the narrative unconscious of works appreciated for qualities other than their treatment of business. This module aims to try and understand not only what drives American culture’s preoccupation with business, but also to study the various strategies used as literature and culture represents what the module calls the discourses of business: the way that business as a theme is written and talked about in the United States, by presidents, by social critics, by journalists, and by writers and other cultural producers; the way that the historical accumulation of this collective input has fashioned a set of rules that govern the way successive generations can think about business; the way that specialised and professionalised languages of business become tropes and metaphors to be used outside of a strictly business environment. The module examines these discourses in a variety of representational forms from the mid-nineteenth century through to the present day: shorts stories and novels; newspapers, magazines and illustrations; speeches, autobiographies and memoirs; film and television. </span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Students who need to complete one or more components of assessment during the summer, due to extenuating circumstances or for progression purposes, will be required to submit one essay of 2,000 words. This form of assessment has been set in order to accommodate early submission deadlines for candidates undertaking a year of study abroad, who will not be resident in Nottingham during the usual summer examination period. The essay will be due on the third Wednesday in July.</span></p>",

From the wide-ranging&nbsp;political and literary magazines of this founding period through the emergence of&nbsp;specialized and mass-market periodicals in the 19th century to the counter-cultural and consumerist magazines of the 20th century this distinctive mode of&nbsp;publication has reflected the tensions and ideals of a rapidly developing society.&nbsp;Using a broad range of representative magazines from different eras this module&nbsp;will encourage students to get to grips with how American culture has shaped, and&nbsp;been shaped by, the periodical, and it will also introduce them to some of the&nbsp;unique literary and institutional qualities of the magazine. Primary sources&nbsp;covered on this module are likely to include The Dial (est. 1840), Harper's (est.&nbsp;1850), The New Yorker (est. 1925), Life (est. 1936) and Rolling Stone (est. 1967).&nbsp;Looked at in the context of their times such sources show us how Americans have&nbsp;long engaged with and debated their own identity through the prism of print, as&nbsp;well as the ways in which this self-definition has changed across time. Moreover,&nbsp;alongside the magazine's regular testing of new political and cultural concepts we&nbsp;will be able to see how the periodical form itself embraced other emerging media:&nbsp;illustration, photography, popular music etc. The main content-spine through each week will be a focus on changes in the nature of American journalism, the rise of&nbsp;modern advertising, and the development of the short story as a form, as well as&nbsp;the interactions between these three elements.

It will cover a range of case studies between Luce’s injunction and the subsequent US entry into World War Two in 1941 and the recent twin-crises marked by the 2008 Great Recession and the Covid-19 global pandemic. In doing so, it will prompt students to consider both the projection of American power on a global scale after 1941 and the considerable challenges that this project faced. Incorporating a series of focused case studies and reflections on the wider contexts relating to them, it will give students first-hand experience of weighing up the practical challenges US policymakers faced and the way that historians have subsequently assessed their efforts and understood their actions. It will make extensive use of recent scholarship that has upended the idea that, in an age when it was the world’s leading power, the US was able to effortlessly project its influence all over the globe. Rather, it will demonstrate the innate limits of America’s global project and chart the considerable difficulties that US policymakers confronted in seeking to bend the world to their will. It will conclude with some reflections on the present state of US power. The case studies it will include are: 1) 1940 and American Globalism; 2) The Bandung Conference, the Global Race Revolution, and the Cold War; 3) The Vietnam Wars; 4) The 1973 Oil Shocks and Globalization; 5) Iran-Contra, the CIA, and Ronald Reagan’s Cold War in the Global South; 6) The Great Recession and Covid-19.</p>",

We examine the vice trades, leisure and mobility, women’s reform organisations, the rise of organised crime syndicates, smuggling and border security, and the expanding crime fighting role of the state. The module concludes with inglorious end of federal Prohibition in the early 1930s.

      "summary": "<p>The first year studio programme is designed to introduce the discipline of architectural design in logical progression. The year starts by setting up an architectural enquiry through observation and awareness of spatial considerations in response to a specific environment. At each key stage new skills are introduced, culminating with the design of a small building which tests students' understanding and application of the knowledge achieved. The focus in year 1 is on communication of an understanding of the client and addressing the unique site with emphasis on clearly demonstrating the process of each individual design. This reflective and narrative approach is backed up with clear analysis and strategic application. The balance between technical rigour and a more individual creative approach is encouraged.</p><p>The studio day usually begins with a lecture which clearly outlines through a pragmatic approach the introduction of new skills to inspire and direct. This is underpinned by a more theoretical exploration through the IDA module and the taught module lecture series.</p><p>From day one you are encouraged to communicate with one another and work both as individuals and as part of a team, this also helps prepare you for the review process. Structured into the first stage is a field trip which helps you get to know each other better both in your units and as a year group.</p><p>The module is structured into three sections. The first two sections are Foundation One and Two: Skill Building in which students are introduced to freehand drawing, perception, spatial composition, observation of people and context in Foundation One and Architectural Orthographic Drawings, model making and analysis of key 20th Century houses in Foundation Two.

      "summary": "<p>The first year studio programme is designed to introduce the discipline of architectural design in logical progression. The year starts by setting up an architectural enquiry through observation and awareness of spatial considerations in response to a specific environment. At each key stage new skills are introduced, culminating with the design of a small building which tests students' understanding and application of the knowledge achieved. The focus in year 1 is on communication of an understanding of the client and addressing the unique site with emphasis on clearly demonstrating the process of each individual design. This reflective and narrative approach is backed up with clear analysis and strategic application. The balance between technical rigour and a more individual creative approach is encouraged.<br>&nbsp;<br>The studio day usually begins with a lecture which clearly outlines through a pragmatic approach the introduction of new skills to inspire and direct. This is underpinned by a more theoretical exploration through the IDA module and the taught module lecture series.<br>&nbsp;<br>From day one you are encouraged to communicate with one another and work both as individuals and as part of a team, this also helps prepare you for the review process. Structured into the first stage is a field trip which helps you get to know each other better both in your units and as a year group.</p><p>The module is structured into three sections. The first two sections are Foundation One and Two: Skill Building in which students are introduced to freehand drawing, perception, spatial composition, observation of people and context in Foundation One and Architectural Orthographic Drawings, model making and analysis of key 20th Century houses in Foundation Two. This is followed by an international filed trip which helps everyone get to know each other better whilst expanding their architectural vocabulary.

Students will consider how different types of indoor &amp; outdoor spaces work. These spaces range in scale, from the qualities of individual rooms &amp; buildings through to the structure, experience &amp; performance of streets, public open spaces &amp; ultimately entire cities. Theories will be introduced which address the breadth and complexity of built environmental design, encompassing urban design, architecture, landscape architecture, sociology &amp; environmental psychology.

Following this, the integrated ‘servicing’ required to manage these flows is explored therefore equipping students with a fundamental knowledge of heating and cooling and how this may be achieved by renewable and energy efficient technologies and systems and building services. By combining both components, students should be in a position to&nbsp;generate suitalble, energy efficient design proposals that respond to user requirements and the climate and following this be able to perform a basic energy / carbon assessment on any building.</p>",

It allows building professionals (e.g. planners/architects and engineers) to produce climate responsive site planning and sustainable/energy efficient building form/shape and thermally comfortable indoor building layout/design, both at individual buildings and urban scale.</p><p>This is a modelling, simulation and design module. It will examine wind environment in the context of architecture, human thermal comfort and ventilation heat loss/gain employing advanced 3D computer simulation techniques (using CFD software ANSYS, plus other supporting computer tools). It will address the processes of wind induced ventilation focusing on site and envelope flows and internal air movement, considering different wind speeds and directions. It will also address the effects of building shape and orientation and building components such as partition walls, windows and doors on outdoor and indoor ventilation design. Students will also gain valuable skills in design and modelling performance of wind towers/catchers and their integration into the building envelope and for the siting of urban wind turbines.</p>",

This process will also engage with interdisciplinary debates in fields such as art, technology, social and cultural studies, politics and ecology, as well as the major schools of twentieth century philosophy, such as Phenomenology, Deconstruction, Structuralism and Critical Theory.</p>",

Challenges to the Profession: The role/use of energy and its reflection in key performance metrics such as PassivHaus, SAP, Approved Document L, etc. as ways to understand/explore/appreciate building design<br>2. Heat Transfer through the Envelope. Homogenous &amp; non-homogenous heat flows in buildings exploriong heat gains/losses via steady state &amp; dynamic heat transfer through building envelopes/elements, including issues such as design detailing, thermal bridging, etc.<br>3 Heat Transfer through Ventilation: The role of ventilation as a gain/loss mechanism, the design of appropriate passive/mixed mode &amp; active strategies, ventilation sizing, etc.<br>4. Heat Gains to Buildings: The key heat gains to buildings via occupancy profiling &amp; scheduling, including solar, lighting, metabolic &amp; appliance gains.<br>5. Dynamic Thermal Behaviour of Buildings: The role of thermally heavyweight and lightweight construction in moderating heat flow.<br>6. Bringing it Together – Energy and Carbon Assessment.

Broadly split into seven inter-related teaching blocks, it deals mainly with the key energy flows (both steady state and dynamic), aiming to provide the student with a comprehensive understanding of the heat loss / gain mechanisms that occur within buildings. Following this, the integrated ‘servicing’ required to manage these flows is explored therefore equipping students with a fundamental knowledge of heating and cooling and how this may be achieved by renewable and energy efficient technologies and systems and building services. By combining both components, students should be in a position to perform a basic energy / carbon assessment on any building.</p>",

Classical sociological theory will introduce students to the ‘big’ ideas and thinkers of the social world, and their interpretations of food. After a reading week, contemporary ideas will be taught, introducing new and radical perspectives on food and systems for the future of nutrition. Students will develop an appreciation of the complex, dynamic nature of food in the social world, exploring what food means from a diverse range of challenging, controversial and contested positions. As the module progresses, students will take part in a weekly photo captioning exercise, illustrating their developing appreciation of the complexities of food in the social world. The sociological theories and ideas taught change annually according to the evolving interests of students, lecturers, and social events. The final assessment will challenge students to make sociological sense of a food and nutrition topic of interest to them, seeing the challenge from the diverse perspectives experienced by their future clients and communities.",

This module provides in-depth understanding of manipulating cells and biological processes together with the application of this knowledge to genetic engineering. Practical methods involve isolating, characterising and functionally analysing genes. We are currently in an era of ‘’Omics’’. Over the past few years major developments have been made regarding the study of genomes. With the advent of next generation and third generation sequencing, whole genome sequences of many species are now available. Such information is revealing a high degree of similarity and conservation between different species and organisms, which in turn is revolutionising the way in which gene function analysis is carried out. An extensive range of post-genomic technologies have been established based on this information and these are revolutionising the analysis that is possible. Case studies will be presented detailing how different approaches have been used to study genomes and how such developments are influencing the way genetic analysis and biotechnological improvement can be made. Particular emphasis will be paid to the importance of bioinformatics in the study of genomes and their expression. Hands-on experience of these approaches will be provided via problem-based lab and computer training sessions. The methods explained by means of lectures, tutorials and practicals are applicable to plant, microbial and animal cells.</p>",

This Module introduces the fundamental knowledge and principles underpinning life from the disciplines of Cell Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. It will compare how procaryotic (bacteria) and eukaryotic (animal and plants) cells are built, replicate, pass on genetic information, control gene expression and translation. This module will also introduce how cells operate on a molecular level: the structure, metabolism, and properties of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids will be examined in relation to their function and regulation. The major metabolic pathways in the cell responsible for energy production (respiration) and biosynthesis of cellular components, including the major pathways of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism along with some aspects of thermodynamics will be covered.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the chemistry of these macromolecules in terms of structure and cellular processes is important as it is the key element in many scientific areas including Animal Science and Human biology, Microbiology, Agriculture, Genetics and Biotechnology.

It will compare the structure of bacterial, animal, and plant cells, from the structure and function of different organelles. A solid foundation in the growth and development of cells will be delivered focusing on mitosis, meiosis, cell division and differentiation. To understand more detailed how cells replicate, differentiate and operate on a molecular level basics of fundamental genetic processes will be covered such as Mendelian laws of inheritance, nucleic acid structure; control of gene expression; genetic variation; mutation and repair; restriction endonucleases. It will then apply the knowledge and explain how this is exploited in recombinant DNA technology. Finally, this module will introduce students to the basic structure, properties and functions of the four key biological macromolecules namely- nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. It also aims to introduce the basic metabolic pathways occurring in cells, such as respiration, photosynthesis, and the biosynthetic pathways for the key macromolecules. Finally, the concepts of regulating these pathways on cellular and organism level will be explored.

      "summary": "<p>This module concerns the roles, functions and values of food and nutrition in the social world, and how they shape, and are shaped by, social processes. In the Autumn, students explore food and social thought, appraising diverse social perspectives on food, nutrition, and health. Students are challenged to develop their sociological imagination, as they learn classical sociological theory concerning the ‘big’ ideas about food and society, and later more radical contemporary perspectives. A weekly photo captioning exercise gives students the opportunity to make sense of their own experience of food, and how it interacts with the world around them. Different social ideas are taught each year, reflecting the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of food and society. In the Spring, the theoretical ideas are put into action, as we imagine new ways of using food to improve social experience, by exploring people-led, grassroots actions which support healthy diets through processes of social change. Each lecture serves as a showcase of grassroots food and nutrition activity, seeing people taking control of the food system to improve health and social justice. Salutogenesis, the social process of health creation, will come to life as we showcase brilliant innovations in local communities, celebrating the value of food in supporting healthy spaces and lives. The final assessment for this module will see you visit a grassroots initiative, to undertake an ethnographic exploration of how people are using food to develop communities and change the world. You will write a reflective, theoretical account of what you experienced, and use it to propose actions you can undertake as a nutritionist to provide support.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Food is only nutritious when it is actually consumed. This module introduces the concept that health outcomes can be improved through the modification of health behaviour. In the first semester, students will explore the psychological influences which determine dietary behaviour (such as the mind, learned response, social cognition and motivation) and the sociological factors which dictate food choice beyond individual control (such as culture, health inequalities, food symbolism and socioeconomic limitations). Models of behaviour change will then combine the agentic and structural factors, as students explore the potential for changing behaviour in professional practice. In the second semester, students will apply concepts from behavioural science to the wider public health agenda, through the study of health promotion. Both individual and collective approaches to promoting health will be explored, with a particular focus on designing and evaluating evidence-based interventions. Students then work in multidisciplinary teams to develop a novel behaviour change or health promotion programme, to solve a public health nutrition challenge of their choice. Though the ideas explored are scientific and evidence-based, the study of social and behavioural science requires rigorous academic discussion and debate. Students will be required to scrutinise and challenge difficult questions, for which there is often no right or wrong answer. This is a highly interactive module, in which students are expected to actively contribute to class discussion and challenge their own preconceptions regarding human behaviour and society.</p>",

This training is designed to be seen as an integral part of their PhD project needs, as well as supporting the development of their professional skills and as part of their exploration of 'what type of scientist do you want to be?'. This module supports the students’ wider reflection on what are their personal development needs within their doctoral training.<br><br>The module consists of eight core topics; 1) Good Research Conduct, 2) Questionable Research Practice, 3) Planning Research, 4) Managing and Recording Research, 5) Data Selection, Analysis and Presentation, 6) Publication, 7) Professional Responsibilities, and 8) Communication. A blended learning approach is taken with each topic covering elements of direct knowledge acquisition, self-directed learning through online materials and group discussion. Group exercises are used in live teaching sessions but also in a series of tutorials spaced over the year. The Tutorials use case studies, role play, and interactive voting approaches to bring the issues “to life” and make them subject specific with examples from relevant research areas being used e.g. animal use in science, global food security and agriculture. The students also attend ‘workshops’ to help them develop and refine their coursework which is an ethical statement that is submitted for assessment at the end of the module.</p>",
      "aims": "<p>&nbsp;· Raise awareness relating to the importance of ethics, integrity, engagement and impact issues in scientific research</p><p>· Provide knowledge of core ethics and integrity concepts, issues and approaches</p><p>· Facilitate the development of skills, through the use of bioscience cases, amongst the researchers so they can anticipate, analyse and respond to issues raised in their research</p><p>· Develop skills to communicate on key issues related to ethics in science</p><p>· Provide opportunities for researchers to reflect on what constitutes good professional practice, and what is important to them as a professional scientist</p>",

Students will develop an appreciation for the amazing potential of consumers and communities, using their knowledge of scope of practice to reflect on how they might support that potential as a nutritionist. Each lecture showcases examples of grassroots food and nutrition activity, in local, national, and global settings, and the grassroots activities will change annually aligned with social developments. The assessment for this module will see you visit a grassroots activity to write an observational, experiential reflection on the connections between food and social action, and how you as a nutritionist might support them.</p>",

Practical sessions cover methods and technologies for measuring root physiology and phenotyping in response to soil conditions. Transferable skills around digital communication of scientific concepts are central to the semester-long assessment along with a team work which is a key employability skill. It is highly suitable for those with interests in plant physiology, environmental biology, crop science or science communication. </span></p>",

It is also the key to tackling environmental degradation and to meeting the increasingly strict regulations on agricultural pollution which are coming into force in many Western countries, while at the same time addressing the effects (current and predicted) of Climate Change. While these issues are not identical, they are linked and efficient plant breeding can be part of the solution to both. The module will use lectures, case and literature studies, research plan presentations, external expert seminars and practical exposure to marker techniques to provide a firm basis for future crop breeding. The emphasis is the application of Biotechnology to conventional breeding, but the place of Genetic Modification in the genetic improvement of crops is briefly considered. Crops covered include temperate and tropical, annual and perennial, in-breeding and out-breeding with emphasis on how genetic improvement will be achieved in the near future, while recognising the potential of novel techniques and the existence of varying priorities, in the face of a changing climate.</p>",

The module will use lectures, case and literature studies, research plan presentations, external expert seminars and practical exposure to crop breeding and molecular techniques to provide a firm basis for future crop breeding. The emphasis is the application of Biotechnology to conventional breeding, but the place of Genetic Modification in the genetic improvement of crops is also addressed. Crops covered include temperate and tropical, annual and perennial, in-breeding and out-breeding with emphasis on how genetic improvement will be achieved in the near future, while recognising the potential of novel techniques and the existence of varying priorities, in the face of a changing climate.</p>",

It provides historical and political analyses of U.S. foreign relations, looking at the themes and traditions that have shaped America's increasing influence in global affairs from the late nineteenth century to the present day. From the war of 1898 to the conflicts of the early twenty-first century, it examines how America's involvement abroad has changed over time. How can we understand the evolution of America's relationship with the wider world; what interests and themes have lay behind the execution of American power? The course analyses traditional political and diplomatic issues, as well as the link between foreign and domestic policies, the role of foreign actors and private organisations-from religious groups to citizen organisations to NGOs that have served to shape America's actions abroad. It also engages with important contemporary trends in the historiography of U.S. foreign policy, including those that emphasise the significance of race, gender, emotions, and religion.</p><p>Students who need to complete one or more components of assessment during the summer, due to extenuating circumstances or for progression purposes, will be required to submit one essay of 2,000 words.

There will be a large emphasis on tackling the different ways that historians have interpreted US foreign policy, but students will be asked to utilise primary source materials, too, in order to form their own assessments and arguments.</p>",
